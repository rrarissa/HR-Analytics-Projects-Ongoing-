# HR-Analytics-Projects-Ongoing-
Since McKinsey proposed the idea of people analytics, a growing number of organisations focused on using advanced HR analytics to identify, attract, develop, and retain talent.   HR analytics is an emerging field, and because of my work content, I want to keep updating a series of projects related to talent analytics. I will only use public datasets online, and I am open to any collaboration and communication.
